"ComprehensiveBird720","10navtx/it_is_a_good_way_to_hide_mockmvcs_assertions",,,"10navtx","I am building a web application using Kotlin and Spring Boot, I use MockMvc to write integration tests.

I'm not satisfied how the assertions looks like:
```kotlin
        @Test
        fun `Get profile by id`() {
            thereIsATeacher(lissaSkipper)

            mockMvc.get("/teacher/{id}", "52058608")
                .andExpect {
                    status { isOk() }
                    jsonPath("$.id") { value("52058608") }
                    jsonPath("$.slug") { value("lissa-skipper-math-teacher") }
                }
        }
```

the `jsonPath("$.id") { value("52058608") }` part, for me, is not good enough. So, I spent a few hours and tried to build "domain assertion", using DSL. Now the test looks:

```kotlin
        @Test
        fun `Get profile by id`() {
            thereIsATeacher(lissaSkipper)

            mockMvc.get("/teacher/{id}", "52058608")
                .andExpect {
                    status { isOk() }

                    teacherProfile {
                        id("52058608")
                        slug("lissa-skipper-math-teacher")
                        profilePhoto {
                            url("https://example.com/photo.jpg")
                            alt("Lissa Skipper - math teacher")
                        }
                        joined("2023-01-22T10:00:00Z")
                    }
                }
        }
```


and here are assertion classes:

```kotlin
fun MockMvcResultMatchersDsl.teacherProfile(assertion: TeacherProfileRestAssertion.() -&gt; Unit) {
    TeacherProfileRestAssertion(this).apply(assertion)
}

class TeacherProfileRestAssertion internal constructor(private val dsl: MockMvcResultMatchersDsl) {

    fun id(expectedValue: String) {
        dsl.jsonPath("$.id") { value(expectedValue) }
    }

    fun slug(expectedValue: String) {
        dsl.jsonPath("$.slug") { value(expectedValue) }
    }

    fun profilePhoto(imageAssertion: ImageRestAssertion.() -&gt; Unit) {
        ImageRestAssertion(dsl, "$.profilePhoto").apply(imageAssertion)
    }
// ...
}

class ImageRestAssertion internal constructor(
    private val dsl: MockMvcResultMatchersDsl,
    private val jsonPrefix: String = "$"
) {

    fun url(expectedValue: String) {
        dsl.jsonPath("$jsonPrefix.url") { value(expectedValue) }
    }
//....
}
```

What do you think? It's a good idea to hide jsonPaths behind such dsl assertions? Or maybe do you have some other elegant solutions to hide technical details behind business code?
